/**
 * Created by arachis on 2017/10/24.
 * Given a non-empty list of words, return the k most frequent elements.
 * <p/>
 * Your answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. If two words have the same frequency,
 * then the word with the lower alphabetical order comes first.
 * <p/>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"], k = 2
 * Output: ["i", "love"]
 * Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
 * Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
 * Example 2:
 * Input: ["the", "day", "is", "sunny", "the", "the", "the", "sunny", "is", "is"], k = 4
 * Output: ["the", "is", "sunny", "day"]
 * Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words,
 * with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
 * Note:
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
 * Input words contain only lowercase letters.
 * Follow up:
 * Try to solve it in O(n log k) time and O(n) extra space
